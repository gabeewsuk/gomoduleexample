# Go Module Example

## Description

This repository contains the Go module I created while following the [official Go tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module). The module demonstrates basic Go functionalities, including creating a Go module, writing a simple function, and testing it. This project serves as a practice for understanding the fundamentals of Go modules.
